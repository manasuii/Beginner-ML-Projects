# Placement_Prediction Using Basic Machine Learning
Built a small ML project to predict student placement using Logistic Regression, based on CGPA and IQ. Implemented data preprocessing, train-test split, feature scaling, model training, evaluation, and visualized decision boundaries. The model was saved and deployed as a web app using Streamlit.
