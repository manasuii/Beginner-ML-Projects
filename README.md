# Beginner-ML-Projects
Project no 1-
Built a small ML project to predict student placement using Logistic Regression, based on CGPA and IQ. Implemented data preprocessing, train-test split, feature scaling, model training, evaluation, and visualized decision boundaries. The model was saved and deployed as a web app using Streamlit.
Project no 2-
This is a small machine learning project aimed at predicting whether a student has completed a test preparation course based on their math and reading scores.
Dataset: StudentsPerformance.csv (Kaggle)
Features: math score, reading score
Target: test preparation course (0 = None, 1 = Completed)
Techniques: Logistic Regression, StandardScaler, Train/Test split, Accuracy evaluation, Decision boundary visualization
Result: Achieved ~63% accuracy using only two features.

Project no3-
Built a small ML project that uses Navier_bayes theorrem to clasify spam messages. The data set has been adapted through kagle datasets
